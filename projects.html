		I am currently working on a Senior Design Project called "Pivott" (<a class="contentLinks" href="https://sites.google.com/site/lexemedhealth20/home" target="_blank">Click here</a> for project site). Pivott is a web application that is all about making data analysis simple for users to understand and more importantly; use. Our goal is to help you answer the questions you've been asking about your health but aren't quite sure how to find the answer. </br>
		<br>We help you answer your question about your health by identifying the key metrics to watch, helping you find ways to track those metrics, and providing a user-friendly interface to; see, interpret, and understand the results and how it brings you closer to answering your questions about your health.</br>
		<br>Pivott will achieve this by aggregating the user data from purchased health sensors or applications such as "FitBit" that track health related data. The idea is to have one simplified user interface for numerious health tracking sites all in one easy to use application.</br>
